    <p>
      Delicious vegan black bean burgers that everyone can enjoy! You don't need
      to follow the recipe or amounts exactly — I never do. Serve with your
      favorite burger fixings and sweet potato fries.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
      <li>3 baby carrots, grated (Optional)</li>
      <li>⅓ cup chopped sweet onion</li>
      <li>¼ cup minced green bell pepper (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>
        3 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®), or to taste
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon warm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning (such as Old Bay®)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 slices whole-wheat bread, torn into small crumbs</li>
      <li>¾ cup unbleached flour, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mash black beans in a bowl. Add carrots, onion, bell pepper, and garlic;
        mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk chile-garlic sauce, cornstarch, water, chili powder, cumin,
        seafood seasoning, salt, and black pepper together in a separate small
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir chile-garlic sauce mixture into black bean mixture; mix in bread
        crumbs. Stir flour, 1/4 cup at a time, into bean mixture until a sticky
        batter forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon mounds of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, about a 3/4-inch
        thickness per mound; shape into burgers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cooked in the center and crisp on the
        outside, about 10 minutes per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
